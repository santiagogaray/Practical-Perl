A)
When I type:
http://elmo.dce.harvard.edu/~username/hw2/hw2p6.cgi 
It displays:
QUERY STRING IS: Buffer contains: 
That is, empty strings.

1. The QUERY_STRING enviroment variable handles a string 
when is used an html 'GET' action to send the input fields' text
within the URL.

2. The buffer variable is loaded with information when the cgi
file is called within a 'POST' method and then the fields' text
is sent to the program using standard input.

B)
When you type:
http://elmo.dce.harvard.edu/~username/hw2/hw2p6.cgi?field1=hello
It displays:
QUERY STRING IS: field1=hello Buffer contains: 
That is a QUERY STRING and an empty buffer.

1. The QUERY_STRING variable is handling in a "direct" way the
information posted in the URL after de '?' symbol.

2. The buffer is not receiving any data because the lack of a
'POST' html command. The 'GET' command whould send the data
only through the QUERY_STRING variable. Therefore 'POST' is neccesary
to place the information in the buffer.
